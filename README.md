## Description

Polish can be difficulty to learn, so I created this [Magic Mirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) module that scrapes a Hindi Word of the Day from [https://www.hindipod101.com/hindi-phrases/](https://www.hindipod101.com/hindi-phrases/). It formats the Hindi word and sentences, and their English translations, creating a result like the one above, and displays it in the document.

Includes:
1. The word of the day
2. The translation of the word
3. The part of speech (noun, verb, etc.)
4. Examples of how to use it in a sentence, plus the English translation

## Technologies

* JavaScript
* Node.js - including Node Helper, Cheerio, and Request-Promise-Native
